# Redux

- Persist state to a local storage and then boot up from it, out of the box.
- Pre-fill state on the server, send it to the client in HTML, and boot up from it, out of the box.
- Serialize user actions and attach them, together with a state snapshot, to automated bug reports, so that the product developers
can replay them to reproduce the errors.
- Pass action objects over the network to implement collaborative environments without dramatic changes to how the code is written.
- Maintain an undo history or implement optimistic mutations without dramatic changes to how the code is written.
- Travel between the state history in development, and re-evaluate the current state from the action history when the code changes, a la TDD.
- Provide full inspection and control capabilities to the development tooling so that product developers can build custom tools for their
apps.
- Provide alternative UIs while reusing most of the business logic.
